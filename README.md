# 📊 CTDC Human Trafficking Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

This project combines **Python‑based data auditing and reshaping** with **Power BI modelling and visualisation** to explore the *Counter‑Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC)* dataset. The aim is to create a transparent, reproducible workflow that highlights both the **scale of exploitation** and the **gaps in data coverage**, while also surfacing gender‑based differences in exploitation pathways.

---

## 1. 🎯 Project Objectives

- Audit the CTDC dataset for **missingness and completeness**  
- Reshape the data into a **long format** suitable for BI tools  
- Integrate **UN population data** to normalise case counts per 100k population  
- Build **Power BI dashboards** that balance absolute counts, per‑capita rates, and coverage indicators  
- Provide **insights by gender, age, region, and exploitation type**  
- Recommend **governance and standardisation steps** for future data collection

## 3. 🧹 Data Audit (Python)

- **Initial load**: ~97k rows × 64 columns. Added a stable `CaseID`  
- **Missingness audit**:  
  - Dropped boilerplate “Terms of Use” column  
  - Computed missing counts/percentages for all fields  
  - Exported styled Excel + CSV summaries  
- **Group completeness**: Defined logical subgroups (Demographics, Control, Exploitation, Recruiter, Abduction)  
  - Found **>85% missingness** in many control/exploitation fields  
  - Demographics relatively complete

- [Group missingness summary (PNG)](https://github.com/Leonw98/ctdc_analysis/blob/main/outputs/group_missing_summary.png)

## 4. 📈 Completeness Trends

- Tracked subgroup completeness by **source and country**  
- Key findings:  
  - **Early years**: exploitation types fairly strong, control data absent  
  - **Mid‑2010s**: improved labour exploitation reporting  
  - **Recent years**: collapse in completeness across most groups  
  - Country coverage uneven (e.g. Egypt, India, Kenya strong; Lebanon, Belarus patchy)

## 5. 🔄 Reshaping for BI

- Problem: wide 0/1 columns not BI‑friendly  
- Solution: reshape to **long format** with demographics repeated  
- Steps:  
  - Fill blanks in demographics  
  - Melt wide table into long format  
  - Keep only rows where flag = 1  
  - Map `SubCategory → ParentCategory`  

Outputs:  
- [Sample CTDC Long with Demographics](https://github.com/Leonw98/ctdc_analysis/blob/main/outputs/samples/sample_ctdc_long.csv)  
- [Sample Subgroup Long](https://github.com/Leonw98/ctdc_analysis/blob/main/outputs/samples/sample_subgroup_long.csv)

## 6. 🌍 Population Integration

- Loaded UN population dataset (`WPP2024_GEN_F01_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS_COMPACT.xlsx`)  
- Extracted **Total Population (thousands)**  
- Scaled by ×1,000 for true counts  
- Exported cleaned lookup:  
  - [Cleaned population lookup](https://github.com/Leonw98/ctdc_analysis/blob/main/data/outputs/cleaned_population_lookup.csv)  

---

## 7. 📐 Power BI Modelling

### Core Measures

```DAX
TotalPopulation =
SUM('cleaned_population_lookup'[PopulationCount]) * 1000

CasesPer100k =
DIVIDE(DISTINCTCOUNT(ctdc[Case No]), [TotalPopulation]) * 100000

PersonsPer100k =
DIVIDE(SUM(ctdc[Persons Identified]), [TotalPopulation]) * 100000

AbductionsPer100k =
DIVIDE(SUM('case_abduction_flags'[isAbduction]), [TotalPopulation]) * 100000
```

### Validation

- Built sanity‑check tables (`Country | Case Count | Population | CasesPer100k`)  
- Corrected inflated rates (e.g. Montenegro 31,200 → 153 per 100k)

## 8. 📊 Dashboard Insights (Gender Filters)

- **Female filter**  
  - Sexual exploitation dominates female cases  
  - Recruitment often via **intimate partners or family members**  
  - Control types lean heavily on **psychological abuse, threats, and restriction of movement**  
  - Broader age spread, including older age brackets  

- **Male filter**  
  - Labour exploitation dominates male cases  
  - Recruitment more **community‑based** (friends, family), with less emphasis on intimate partners  
  - Control types show more **direct coercion** (physical abuse, economic abuse, threats)  
  - Age distribution concentrated in **working‑age brackets (22–46)**, with notable presence of adolescents in forced labour/criminality  

- **Not Known filter**  
  - Smaller group, but important to track as it highlights **data quality gaps**  
  - Often under‑specified in both exploitation type and control methods  
  - Should be flagged in dashboards as “data incomplete” rather than ignored

## 9. 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Normalisation matters**: per‑100k rates reveal vulnerabilities in small states  
- **Gendered patterns**: females → sexual exploitation, psychological control; males → labour exploitation, physical coercion  
- **Recruitment**: often by trusted individuals, not strangers  
- **Coverage gaps**: labour exploitation under‑reported, sexual exploitation uneven  
- **Transparency**: dashboards show counts + rates + coverage %  

---

## 10. 🚀 Next Steps

- **Data Governance & Oversight**  
  - Establish a **project group or steering committee** to oversee CTDC data collation methods  
  - Define a shared **ideology and methodology** for data capture, ensuring consistency across sources  
  - Set **clear goals for data completeness** (e.g. minimum % coverage for control type, exploitation type, recruiter relation)  

- **Standardisation**  
  - Agree on **controlled vocabularies** for exploitation types, control methods, and recruiter relations  
  - Standardise demographic categories (age bands, gender identities) to reduce fragmentation  
  - Document and publish a **data dictionary** for all contributors  

- **Quality Monitoring**  
  - Build **completeness dashboards** that track missingness by source, country, and gender  
  - Flag sources consistently under‑reporting certain fields  
  - Provide **feedback loops** to data providers to improve future submissions  

- **Strategic Use**  
  - Pair **absolute counts** with **per‑capita rates** and **coverage indicators** in all reporting  
  - Use gender‑split dashboards to highlight **different exploitation pathways**
